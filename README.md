# BlogCompile
A super-simple static blog engine using Python, reStructuredText (for post authoring), and the Mako template library.

BlogCompile's source is less than 150 lines of code. The rest is Mako templates and HTML/CSS.

BlogCompile used to power http://www.farmcodegary.com but that site has since been moved over to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).

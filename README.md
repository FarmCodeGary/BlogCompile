# BlogCompile
A super-simple static blog engine using Python and the Mako template library.

BlogCompile's source is less than 150 lines of code. The rest is Mako templates and other assorted HTML, CSS, etc.

BlogCompile used to power http://www.farmcodegary.com but it has since been moved over to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).
